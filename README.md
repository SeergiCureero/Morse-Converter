Hello!

This project has extra files that hopefuly would help you understand how PySerial works (at least you can see my learning path) 

However I recomend reading the PySerial documentation

Not all the code is mine but I made this project a long ago and I don't remember where I copied code from. If I remember, I would credit the source 

Sorry :(
